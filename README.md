Realistic Face Generation and Deepfake Speech Synthesis <br />

Problem Statement: <br />
Creating realistic digital avatars has traditionally been a
challenging and resource-intensive process.
Current methods, such as CGI and manual animation, are not
only costly but also require significant time and effort to
achieve a convincing level of realism.
The demand for realistic avatars is growing across various
industries, from content creation to interactive virtual
assistants, yet existing solutions often fall short in delivering
high-quality results.

Introduction: <br />
Advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in the fields of
generative models and deepfake technologies, have made it possible
to create synthetic faces that look strikingly real. We aim to harness
these advancements by using Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs), to generate lifelike human faces. Furthermore, we integrate
these generated faces with deepfake techniques to animate them to
speak given text inputs in a highly realistic manner.

Proposed Solution: <br />
Our proposed solution leverages advanced AI models to
create a seamless and highly realistic digital avatar
experience. By using GAN, we generate high-resolution
synthetic faces that can be customized to meet specific
needs. To animate these faces, we use state-of-the-art Text-
to-Speech (TTS) models to convert input text into natural-
sounding speech. This speech is then synchronized with the
lip movements of the generated faces using deepfake lip-
sync models.
